### Welcome to my master thesis!

The focus of my work is on Model Predictive Control of HP+TES (heat-pump + thermal energy storage) systems for demand flexibility.

I started with a relatively simple system as a "warm-up" problem. Description of the system and the model can be found in a PDF file in the corresponding directory.

I am now focusing on implementing MPC on a more complex system.
