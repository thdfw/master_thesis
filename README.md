### Welcome to my master thesis!

The focus of my work is on Model Predictive Control of HP+TES (heat pump + thermal energy storage) systems for demand flexibility.

During the first weeks of my thesis, I sucessfully implemented MPC on a relatively simple HP+TES system. From there, I have been focusing on a similar but more challenging system.
